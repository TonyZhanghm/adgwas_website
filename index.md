## GWAS on Alzheimer's Disease

---

### Background
Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive disease that causes physical and psychological damages. It causes memory loss, personality/mood alteration, confusion/disorientation, impaired movements, apathy, frustration and even violent behavior. There are more than 3 million cases in the United States per year and those conditions can only be reduced rather than be cured.

### Overview
The goal of our study is to identify potential risk genes/loci that have a significant association with Alzheimer’s Disease across a variety of races. Identifying risk genes would significantly help doctors and scientists to better study the development of the disease and potentially come one step closer to the day where we can prevent the disease or even cure it.

### Dataset
We are using a dataset from Dr. Amanda J. Myers at the University of Miami School of Medicine. This dataset comprises 364 samples of cases and controls. Cases include European descent over the age of 65 who are diagnosed with LOAD.
